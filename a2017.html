            I am who I am
            <br> 
            <br>
            You cannot judge me upon the clothes I wear or with the people I go out with without knowing me inside out you have no right to decide who I am
            <br> 
            <br>
            Just because I have a lot of male friends it does not make me characterless I have a right to do whatever I wish to And speak my heart out Just because I'm a girl you cannot be superior to me I can go where I want, do what I want, no one can judge me upon the things I do, your opinion doesn't matter to me, I'm hugely flawed and I like it this way. I'm sculpted to be my own hero. I have a power and that power is I'm a woman
            <br> 
            <br>
            I can rule where I want and be what I wish to I'm a woman and I'm unstoppable
            <br> 
            <br>
            Breathe. It's okay. You're going to be okay. Just breathe. Breathe, and remind yourself of all the times in the past you felt this scared. All of the times you felt this anxious and this overwhelmed. All of the times you felt this level of pain. And remind yourself how each time, you made it through. Life has thrown so much at you, and despite how difficult things have been, you've survived. Breathe and trust that you can survive this too. Trust that this struggle is part of the process. And trust that as long as you don't give up and keep pushing forward, no matter how hopeless things seem, you will make it.
            <br>

        <hr>
        <pre class="text-center" style="font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif;">
A nine year old went off,
Jumping happily,
Rushed to his favourite
Ice-cream parlour.
He got a dollar
From his dad.
Happily wandering,
He reached.
He saw a poor alongside
With the parlour,
Looking at the people
Bitterly.
Maybe he was hungry,
Hungry from some
Disheartening nights.
Boy stared at him
For few.
He remembered about
What he had,
And he looked at him
feeling sad.
His hearth felt
Something,
Something harrowing,
Something hurtful,
Maybe the ache.
Ache of suffering,
Ache of ignorance,
Ache of inhumanity.
He went to him,
Smiled,
Gave him his dollar
And ran back
Ran back happily,
Cheerfully and
Blissfully!
Maybe he was not
So rich but,
He was richer than
So many people
Nowadays.
He was rich in
Terms of kindness,
He was rich in
Terms of benevolence,
He was rich in
Terms of heart.
He was rich in
Terms of HUMANITY !
- Mahima.

                What is Deep Learning?
                <br> 
                <br>
                Well, Humans are self learning animals as this thought also comes to computer era that what happened if computer can learn itself. So basically Deep learning is concept in which, we teach something to computer and after computer automatically works and improve its knowledge .To understand What is Deep Learning, Lets Take an example,
                <br> 
                <br>
                There is problem in parking lot where 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler parking is different, so in this scenario we need some solution to solve this problem.
                <br> 
                <br>
                However if our computer knows that whether it is two wheeler or four wheeler vehicle then it automatically separate vehicles. To Accomplish we give some knowledge about 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler than computer automatically works on it.
                <br> 
                <br>
                There are two phases in which Classification occurs.1 – Training Phase 2 – Predication Phase
                <br> 
                <br>
                In Training Phase, we tell computer about object by images, labels, and other objective information.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Machine use this information to train itself.
                <br> 
                <br>
                In Predication Phase, we give some new object to computer to identify object.Computer uses its knowledge of previous training to identify the object.So basically it is quite difficult for new comer to computer era which has no knowledge about it. Don't worry, Biggest Search Engine Google Develop one api called Tensorflow to simplify this process.
                <br> 
                <br>
                What is Tensorflow?? What it can Do !!
                <br> 
                <br>
                Tensorflow is An Open Source Library for Machine Intelligence. It contains lots modules which help you to make machine self learned. It is Available For Java, Python, C++Now Think, How Google Image Search Works???Simply Google Shows lots of new images to its servers. Machine extract information about images such as rgb code, label, resolution, graphs and train itself with previousknowledge. When user upload image to find similar images, It extract same info try to best match with predictions.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Then servers make a list of possible output which nearly matched with given images.
