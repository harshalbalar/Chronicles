            'Always find time for the things that make you feel happy to be alive'
            <br> 
            <br>
            Dear Readers!
            <br> 
            <br>
            Greetings! We bring you to the magazine of Babu Madhav Institute of Information Technolgy's - 'BMIIT Chronicles'. BMIIT-Chronicles gives an opportunity to everyone to showcase their creativity and talent. This issue- Spring 2018 is based on the theme 'Be Alive!'
            <br>
            <br>
            'When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive- to breathe, to think, to enjoy , to love. ' -Marcus Aurelius
            <br>
            <br>
            None of us are guaranteed a tomorrow. Yet, when someone dies unexpectedly it causes us to take stock of our own life: whatís really important, how we spend our time and how we treat other people.
            <br>
            <br>
            Remind yourself every morning when you wake up that each day is a gift and youíre bound to make the most of the blessing youíve been given. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing is the moment it will start acting like one.
            <br>
            <br>
            After all, a great day begins with a great mindset.
            <br>

            <br>
            FIVE QUESTIONS
            <br> 
            <br>
            Ask yourself the following questions every day:
            <br> 
            <br>
            What am I thankful for today? <br>

            How did I take care of myself today?
            <br> 
            <br>
            What am I thankful for? <br>
            Character includes being honest, honorable, and appreciative. It is giving fair return for what you receive and not taking what isn't yours. Appreciating what you have and receive enlightens your spirit and shows your character. A person who is thankful is often a person who is good. <br>
            Ask yourself: "What am I thankful for today?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            What did I learn? <br>
            You should be able to learn something every day, no matter how old you are. Observe and be curious. There is so much to learn in life. <br>
            Ask yourself: "What did I learn today?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            Where did I do a good job? <br>
            Doing high quality work in what you do is important to you and to others. This includes improving the way you do things. <br>
            Ask yourself: "Where did I do a good job today?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            Who was I valuable to? <br>
            Helping others get what they want makes you valuable. This includes taking an interest in what someone has to say, being friendly, and being considerate. <br>
            Ask yourself: "Who was I valuable to today?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            How did I take care of myself? <br>
            Taking care of yourself means that you made an effort to be healthy. You may have eaten healthy foods, exercised, or avoided abusing your body with bad substances. <br>
            Ask yourself: "How did I take care of myself today?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            If you want to change your life in positive way, if you really want happy life. Then ask these five questions every day to yourself. Your perspective on life will change. This will summarize what life is about.

            <pre style="font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif;font-size: 17px;">
Wishing the meadows would again be green,
Greenery now-a -days is nowhere to be seen.
No one has time or curiosity,
To relax and take a look at the city..!!
Children are ignorant, not positive,
They are either naughty or inactive,
Life is boring and life style dull.
Robots everywhere, it’s a computerized world..!!
Neither are there bees, nor flowers to be seen.
In finding faults people become so keen,
The sun has lost its shine,
Will the moon remain for all the time?
Murder, assault, such is the news that we read
Are we not killing our own seeds?
Science is developing While humanity is
Committing suicide,
Our innermost beauty we keep aside.
Science is loyal slave for sure
But if it becomes master…
We will be no more..!!

            What is life....
            <br>
            <br>
            People explain their life in many ways like as some people say that life is a game and life is a journey .Some say it's a gift from God But according to me life is only a chance lets understand .There are many people you see around you, some of them are successful, some of them are struggling ,some of them are failures.
            <br>
            <br>
            Take life as only one chance because there is no new chance if you quit or waste your life as many people do...
            <br>
            <br>
            If you don't try for something new or waste your life as some of the people that is not a big deal but if you do something that’s worth remembering that will make you feel good!
            <br>
            <br>
            This is only and final chance to deal with something big that makes your life remarkable and rememberable.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some people compare life as game but I want to say that life is not a game because you can replay the game but life comes only once.... And some people compare life as journey but I want to say that during journey you take a break and take rest but in life you can not take break its an endless journey. Its your stage and you need to become hero of your own stage, only you can change your life. Just Get Up Dress Up And Never Give Up!!
            <br>
            <br>
            Let us end with one famous dialogue of Rajesh Khanna
            <br>
            <br>
            “Babu Moshai Zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahi.. Maut ke darr se agar zinda rehna chodhu, to maut kisse kehte hain? Babu Moshai jab tak zinda hoon, tab tak mara nahi hoon. Jab marr gaya, saala mein hi nahi. Toh phir darr kiss baat ka.” – Anand

                Human Behaviour:
                <br>
                <br>
                Humans , Known by their behaviour!
                <br>
                <br>
                Behaviour is impacted by certain traits each individual has. Behaviour shows intramural beauty of human! As every coin has two sides human also have tendency to hold both acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.Behaviour shows intramural beauty of the human but yes , every-time it isn't obligatory that human with good behaviour are only human with good soul , some humans are very benign but they are not able to express as they want to express something but they express something else and people guess that (as they're so expert in guessing) this human is not splendid when actually he/she is! That's why one should be very meticulous about his/her behaviour so that he/she can get as much as reverence as he/she deserves!
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's surmise a good behaviour as a salt and bad behaviour as spices used while cooking as every food needs sufficient salt and spices turn out to be tasty , some kind of limited unhealthy behaviour is also necessary to turn out their life to be fine and deal with some negativity and there is nothing obnoxious in it but if it's not limited then surely it becomes an obnoxious!
                <br>
                <br>
                So be the human with positive mind and thought because they also do impacton our behaviour. no one will remember you by your beauty of face but by your inner beauty and that is your behaviour towards other!

                'Fear of death follows from the fear of life.A man who lives fully is prepared to dieat any time.' - Mark TwainIn the world full of enemies and cruel people, there stands two individuals whose love is unconditional and only those are our in real sense. From the starting till the end -
                <br>
                <br>
                You only live once,and life is tragically short,it's easy to look at people who arehappy and assume they don't understand your pain.The older you get,the more you realize that happiness takes work.People who smile in public have been through every bit as muchas people who cry,frown,scream,etc.They just have the courage and strength to smile through it anyway.
                <br>
                <br>
                It doesn't matter what it is.Don't do what you think people want you to do.Sometimes there's danger involved in life,but every reward carries risk with it.If you never take risks,you'll never get anywhere in life.Your past is important to learn from.Don'tcompromise on your internal code of ethics.No matter what you decide to do with your life,there will always be someone around to point out the many ways you'll fail.Know that every winner losses,but not every loser wins.Successful people don't start out successful. What makes them successful is that they keep pushing through failure.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have a interest in someone,just go for it.There are a lot of ways it may end, and only one of them keeps them in your life forever.Just go for it.You have nothing to lose. <br>
                Just beacause you are right about something doesn't mean there aren't other ways to look at it .Listening to ideas you don't agree with or understand keeps your brain active and healthy fullest.
                <br>
                <br>
                All it takes to live your life to the fullest is courage-nothing more and nothing less.This sounds rather minimalist and easy to cope with but a lack of courage is a key factor that prevents most people from living their lives to the fullest.These peoplearen't necessarily cowards or scared-chicken-not at all- as they are simply being struck with their quite comfortable everyday routines.To express it metaphorically : there are some dreams that you do not want to end.Courage is a crucial factor-as you can not live your life to the fullest if you don't dare to do it or shy the risks that couldcome with it.
                <br>
                <br>
                At The End Most important love your life to the fullest,live without regrets...

                Gratitude in Life
                <br>
                <br>
                If in world something exist then behind it, it has its own reason, it has its own meaning...nothing is worthless.Gratitude is good for the body, mind and soul.In my life I am really impressed by the words said by Ma'am Muniba Mazari, a woman from Pakistan,who met up in a car accident which deforms her body but transforms her soul for the rest of her life ,and that was the turning point of her life.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you think your life is hard and you give up on that because your life is unfair.Think again !!!Because when you think that way then, you are being unfair to your ownself !
                <br>
                <br>
                Sometimes problems are not too big, we are too small to handle them.There are so many people in the world, who are dreaming a life which you are living now, you have no idea about it !! So be grateful for what you have.Celebrate your life, live it to the fullest, Don't die before your death.
                <br>
                <br>
                Real happiness does not lies in success,money,fame but it lies in gratitude.Words can make you, break you, even damage your soul forever. Therefore, use positive words for yourself because those words have the power to heal your soul.
                <br>
                <br>
                Don't be perfect for someone, be perfect for yourself. If your soul is perfect within, that is right, that is all what you want and that is all what you need.There may be haters,there may be disbeleivers and there will be you who will proving them all wrong.Sometimes we are too busy thinking about the things that we don't have and we forget to cherish the blessings that we have at present.

                <br>
                This life is a test and trial and test is a trial that are not supposed to be easy.It is ok to be scared, it is ok to cry, everything is ok but, giving up should not be an option. Failure should be an option because when you fail you get up and then you fail and again get up and that keeps you going. Life is not of being alive, make money for yourself, but it is when you help others who does not give up because of you is what the life is and real happiness lies there.There is a saying that, "Excess of anything is bad". So, neither overestimate yourself nor underestimate yourself.Accept yourself the way you are... the sooner the better.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hence I conclude by saying that, Live your life fully, accept yourself theway you are, be kind to yourself and then only you can be kind to others.BE GRATEFUL, BE ALIVE.
