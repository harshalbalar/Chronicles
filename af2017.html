            What is Poverty:- 
            <br> 
            <br>
            Poverty is one of the most attention-able situations of any country. Poverty means living the life below the poverty line. If a person is having difficulties in survival and is struggling for the fulfillment of the basic needs (food, water and shelter) then he/she is said to be facing the situation called poverty. Poverty is a shameful situation for any independent country whether the country is industrial or non-industrial.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Talking about INDIA, No doubt, INDIA is developing day by day and joining hands with the most economical and industrial countries but it is also not left behind for facing such a situation
            <br>
            <br>
            After getting Independence, poverty is obvious but after 60 years of independence, how one can still imagine the poverty and lack of resources.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main cause of poverty is illiteracy. INDIA is a rural country and villages are not yet developed in India; especially women are unable to get education. Second main cause of poverty is the population which is increasing day by day and India ranks on second number in this line and I would say that the population is the major problem and the root cause for any nation to be poor. China has world’s highest population but they are now putting a check on the growing population and also, their land area is also very huge as compared to India. In a poor nation, middle class is also unable to fulfill all their requirements as compared to high society.
            <br>
            <br>
            Poverty can be removed by awareness so that they can themselves make a check on increasing population. The only thing which is required is to keep a check on increasing births in the nation. People must know the value of education and political parties must be honest so that the future of India can be secured and INDIA must join hands with the developed and modern industrial countries

            You must be wondering why,well you must have seen sheep how they walk in herds.They follow the leader and they are often led to slaughterhouses.They keep following without using their mind,they are not a leader.In that case a lion leads,it has the courage and strength that is why eveyone fears it.So it is about having the courage to follow your dreams,be who you want to be and have the strength to stand up for youself.Everyone has the heart of a lion inside them you just need to let it out,unleash the beast in you. Attitude is about what you think,what you do,how you feel about yourself. It is all about having the right attitude at the right time. May it be when you rise or when you fall,your attitude at that moment matters the most. It isn't about money,money may solve some problems but not all of them. What you think of yourself,are you bold enough? Do you have the lion attitude which says I can and I will. Well if you don't have it,you will have to get it otherwise you will be a follower like the sheep. Be hungry like a lion,once a lion is on a mission it completes it. Be a leader not a follower.Be a lion,be fearless,demostrate who you are,lions do not seek respect,they command respect and authority because they know they should be respected.It is about having the courage to stand up and fight for your life,having the strength to go in your own direction,making your own path even if no one believes in you,follow your heart because only you know what is best for you!Dont fit in,stand out and use your abilities. Be certain about everything there shouldn't be a 'maybe'. 'This is my decision and I will attack until the outcome is mine'. No one can push you around and tell you what to do.If you want something you have to go after it like how a lion hunts its prey.Don't lose your uniquness,don't be what others want you to be. Be like a lion,roar so loud so that no one doubts your spirit,no one questions your goals,no one will dare challenge you again because you will certainly shine through everything.

            Late at night with the deepest secrets of mine, and with the unsaid spoken of yours.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's bleed from the hidden wounds we both has taken care of, and tried to keep it as fresh as it was,
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's bleed,
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's bleed in words
            <br>
            <br>
            When you will be unveiling the pains, very well nurtured, I might look deep in your eyes. And I might wonder how beautiful the cosmos is, within them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let our hearts melt from the eyes. Let it flow through our cheeks, with our eyelids shut. For one more time, let our soul to roll the dice.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's rain over the melancholies, interrupting the very plans of happiness. Let's get the roads between us flooded. We will wait until it's dry.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's confess the wishes we made over those shooting stars. And also the regrets, which we don't regret.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let our silent eyes, scream. <br>
            Late at night, in the insomnia,
            <br>
            <br>
            let's share our half seen dreams.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's share our almost and maybes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's agree how foolishly we both wanted to witness two parallel line's meet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's talk about all the backspaces and torn apart letters, unreached.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's reveal each other like we are drunk at 3am, in the intoxicated night.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's also admit how we had taken care of the devils inside. And also made the satanic angels, plead.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's open the bandages of our broken hearts, and after ages, let it heal.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's rob the sorrows. And gift happiness to each other, with the wrap of our eternal smiles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's fill each other up, inch by inch, just by letting our eyes, speak.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's be brave enough in the tornado. Brave enough to allow it taking us far away from here, to there, where we are destined to be.
            <br>
            <br>
            Late at night,
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's bleed.
            <br>

            <p>
                By 2020, it’s estimated that around 20 billion ‘connected things’ can be found in an IoT environment.It will be a challenging task to build interfaces that can handle the huge amount of things and data that come with this development. In this article, I will elaborate on the possible role of chatbots within this environment.
                <br> 
                <br>
                What exactly is a chatbot?
                <br> 
                <br>
                There are already well known examples of AI and chatbots, for example Cleverbot, Cortana or Tay. Tay, Microsoft’s first public experiment with a Twitter bot, was so successful that it started mimicking its followers. However, after 16 hours of being “alive” Microsoft had to pull Tay’s plug because it had turned into a feminist bashing racist xenophobe. Even though it was considered a failure, it showed how much the technology around smart chatbots had evolved. Tay could give coherent and meaningful answers to questions and even join a whole conversation.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Chatbots use a dialog system to have a conversation with a human. There are a few steps a chatbot goes through to process human information:
                <br> 
                <br>
                The first step is converting human input into an understandable context for the chatbot. This is done through input recognizers and decoders, which can analyze speech, text and even gestures. The next step is applying Natural Language Processing to analyze the plain text and search for semantics. All the while the input is managed and processed by a dialog manager to ensure a correct flow of information from and to the participant.
                <br> 
                <br>
                The dialog manager also makes sure that questions or issues are assigned to the right task manager and solved. After the tasks are solved the output manager translates the solution into “human like output”. This is done through a natural language generator to mimic human speech. The output rendered will then regulate how the output is communicated, e.g. through audio, voice and in a visual format as well.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Depending on the status of advancement of the natural language processing and its engines for processing the information, the chatbot is thus able to mimic human language and interpret and communicate efficiently. So how can the chatbot be helpful to an IoT environment?
                <br> 
                <br>
                An interface for an IoT environment?
                <br> 
                <br>
                In an IoT environment, chatbots can function as an interface to make sense of all the data and also make it more accessible.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Amazon Echo is an example of integrating speech in your chatbot experience, it will allow you to order anything from the Amazon webshop. A new report, states that Amazon has sold near 3 million Amazon Echo smart speakers which supports the belief that chatbots are the future of IoT and retail.

            <p>Imagine a place where all your dreams took the shape of relaity. Imagine a house made up of chocolate, imagine a college where everyday would be a house party or a life where each moment was fictional . They say" there is no end to fictional imagniation . You can go on and on but there is never an end." The life we live is called practical living . We have a festivals,expenses,exams, submissions,parties and even time in a fixed number . We live a planned life in an unplanned way. But taking the creative liberty we have been bestowed the power of imagining things. Elber einstein said," the true sign of intelliegene is not knowlegde but imagination." Think of the older times when people used to live in caves and had the most basic life . If at that time somebody thought of mobile phones, which could help people see each other sitting at two corners of the globe it would be called a fictional dream. But today, it is a reality . Talking of "IF LIFE WAS FICTIONAL" immediately many thoughts come rushing to our minds . The windows of our dream open. We imagine of robots doing our assignments,exams free colleges,flying cars,meeting our favourite celebs almost everyday and on and on and on. A life which is fictinol would comprise of anything iyou want . All your stress would never exists. You would have no worries and only fun. We spend huge chunks of our life emersed in novels,films,tv shows and other mediums. This gifts birth to our imagination. The genre of fiction is like an ocean which reasonably has no possible end. God has given us the valuable gift of imagination for a reason. The reason is that we imagine things and find ways of turning that into reality or to reach a happy place in life . But having said that we should not get completly immersed into a dream life and loose the touch with reality,what we should do is live a practical lives with a sprinkle of imagination. See dreams, believe in them and work your hardest to turn your imagination into reality. If life would be fictional we would have nothing to worry about but our life is made up of 99% reality and 1% fiction, that 1% is the magic we believe in , the faith we have, the hope in our hearts. Concluding my article i would like to say that we do not have a fictional life but we sure have a mind which has the power to move mountains if we decide.

                  why colleage life is important part of life??
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  through responsibilities are part of our life but friends are imaportant too.friendship made in college is an important part of one's personal desicion. because we accept people judiciously. it's not likw in school where ever classmate and every person we talk to become our very good friends. friendship made in college last long. and are deeper. and of course we learn to be diplomatic too. that's an important part of one's growth. we feel ourselves getting elder.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  college life a very important part of every individual's life. we ll are at a certain threshold after passing out from school. that's when we have to take a very important desicion. that's regarding one's carrer. school is a small institution.college broadens one's horizon. it's a bigger place. a boarder platform to understand and prove ourseleves. it's a place where one is assumed to be an adult. need to be a little more mature than how we were at school. it's a place where we create a bigger foundation of ourlife. it's place where we find and create ourselves.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  college life is a bound free life. here nobody is behind anbody for doing class. nobody is there to see who is bunkingand where they are. that's why amidst sll fun of bunking there lies a responsibility of every stuent to understand that how much loss or gain they are doing to themselves by that. fun and sincerity should not happen at the cost of other. otherwise we will miss out one or both. some pepole get married just after college. some choose to do job and some go for higher studies. everyone havetheir own choices. so colleage life is a very memorable part of everyone's scarpbook, personal diary, photo album or anything else. so guies dont waste your college memorable life.

                In the world full of enemies and cruel people, there stands two individuals whose love is unconditional and only those are our in real sense. From the starting till the end -
                <br>
                <br>
                ”PARENTS... Yes parents are the one who put up there child above their own needs and wants. After becoming parents, a couple's life is centered around their little bunch of happiness. A couple transforms into "Mummy" and "Daddy" and everything before 'us' is then converted into 'our baby'. Throughout their life, they provide the best things for their children, whereas, sometimes they go beyond their limits just for their kids so that they won't be facing the same problems that they had faced in their past life. They are the ones who serve as role models for their children not only through their direct interaction with their child but also by sharing their lives. Parents have unconditional love for kids. Just by entering into their old age, parents turn out be similar to kids and need to be loved and taken care of. And the thing which matters the most is that, parents never retire. Maybe their words of wisdom don’t hold relevance in today’s world but experience is the best teacher. After all sacrifices if a parent doesn’t even gets love and respect, imagine what would be their condition. Just genuine love and being there when they need us is more than sufficient for them to feel proud of their upbringing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Parents are those trunk of a tree which bare beautiful branches and flourish them to reach up to the sky...With love and harmony, both, parents and children make up a beautiful and peaceful atmosphere to live in.
