            'Always find time for the things that make you feel happy to be alive'
            <br> 
            <br>
            Dear Readers!
            <br> 
            <br>
            Greetings! We bring to you the magazine of Babu Madhav Institute of Information Technolgy's - 'BMIIT Chronicles'. BMIIT-Chronicles gives an opportunity to everyone to showcase their creativity and talent. This issue- Spring 2018 is based on the theme 'Be Alive!'
            <br>
            <br>
            'When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive- to breathe, to think, to enjoy , to love. ' -Marcus Aurelius
            <br>
            <br>
            None of us are guaranteed a tomorrow. Yet, when someone dies unexpectedly it causes us to take stock of our own life: what’s really important, how we spend our time and how we treat other people.
            <br>
            <br>
            Remind yourself every morning when you wake up that each day is a gift and you’re bound to make the most of the blessing you’ve been given. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing is the moment it will start acting like one.
            <br>
            <br>
            After all, a great day begins with a great mindset.

        <h2 class="heading">The Habit Of A Smile</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This is a fun post about smiling. Why fun? Well let’s face it, when we’re smiling we are normally having a pretty good time!
            <br> 
            <br>
            If you were to ask someone who knows me to describe who I am, undoubtedly one of the first things that they will say is that I am a continually happy or ‘smiley’ person. This is something that I always laugh about as it has been mentioned many times throughout my life! The good thing is I’m not complaining as a smile has a tonne of benefits to your overall wellbeing. Smiling is number 2 on the list of the 43 Habits of Absolutely Happy People. If you can turn smiling into a habit, then you can turn happiness into a habit.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Have you ever been in a sour mood and then someone has come along with a huge smile, some laughter or in a really good mood? Perhaps a baby that just looked up at you and smiled? How did this make you feel? When the person you are talking to or the people that surround you are smiling, you won’t be able to help but smile!
            <br> 
            <br>
            A smile has special powers. You can calm fear, insecurity, hurt and anxiety not only in yourself, but in those that are experiencing those feelings. The next time someone is feeling sad, scared, nervous, whatever it may be, smile with them and see how this makes them feel!

            <br>
            <br>
            EXPECTATION OF A GIRL!
            <br>
            <br>
            The life we girls live have never been easy for us. Right from the time we born we are also taught to rather accept things than to expect. But , the human nature cannot be changed be it a girl or a boy. As a girl , I have many expectations from life. From the day I was born , I had the expectation of being loved always. I loved all the attention as a kid and still love it! When I became a little older I expected my life to be a full time games period. I loved to play and play. As I became a teenager, the expectations increased a little . I always wanted to look good all the time, want to go on adventure trips and what not. I expected my friends to stick around all the time.I expected life to be like the Bollywood-movie like. I had a dream to become an Event planner, but as being a girl, rather than expecting support, i had to accept that it wont work-out.! And by the passing time , I kind of realised that many of those dreams wont really work out. !
            <br>
            <br>
            As a girl , I dont expect my life to be without any difficulties but I expect that I should have strength at all the difficult times . I do not expected life to be candy sweet but I expect random surprises which would be welcomed. As a girl, I expect that all the choices I make in life should make my parents proud. Furthermore , I expect my life partner to respect and adore my feelings towards everything. I expect that I can raise citizens to can make our country proud. Being a girl , I expect to be respected by all the men and be seen as a equal. The expectation to see around enough places that I can have enough stories to tell . The expectation to be a sucessfull person and even if not the expectation to feel confident and Love myself above all .

                #HumFitTohIndiaFit
                <br> 
                <br>
                Health or can say a good health is really importanat for one and all who is surviving, whether a human beings, animals, birds, each and every living organism on tis planet. To be fit is really means alot to one's life.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Both, health and fitness are closely inter-related to each other. Both are necessary for the human being to live a happy and healthy life. There are various things we have to take care all through the life in order to be healthy and fit like Meditation, Yoga, High Fibre diet, Running, Cycling, etc...
                <br> 
                <br>
                But for me, fitness is not just about hitting the gym; it is also about an inner happiness and an overall well-being.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Think positive and have patience and commitment towards good lifestyle.
                <br> 
                <br>
                As Indian PM's challenge 'Hum Fit toh India Fit' is aimed at changing people's mindset towards fitness. And it gave much impact on every single youth, and even on old age people too.
                <br> 
                <br>
                As today's life ,somewhat we are not taking our care properly and just we are getting busy day to day, and because of that human health is getting weak and poor . So besides work, health is so much important to live a Happy, Peacfull and a long healthy life.
                <br> 
                <br>
                So this is just a way to avoid all those problems like Heart Disease, High blood problem, Back pain, Disability, Self Esteem and Stress Management, etc..
                <br> 
                <br>
                So that we can manage our health with a work too and by this challenge only we will be fit and can say our India will be fit..
                <br> 
                <br>
                STAY HAPPY, STAY FIT😊

            <p>Imagine a place where all your dreams took the shape of relaity. Imagine a house made up of chocolate, imagine a college where everyday would be a house party or a life where each moment was fictional . They say" there is no end to fictional imagniation . You can go on and on but there is never an end." The life we live is called practical living . We have a festivals,expenses,exams, submissions,parties and even time in a fixed number . We live a planned life in an unplanned way. But taking the creative liberty we have been bestowed the power of imagining things. Elber einstein said," the true sign of intelliegene is not knowlegde but imagination." Think of the older times when people used to live in caves and had the most basic life . If at that time somebody thought of mobile phones, which could help people see each other sitting at two corners of the globe it would be called a fictional dream. But today, it is a reality . Talking of "IF LIFE WAS FICTIONAL" immediately many thoughts come rushing to our minds . The windows of our dream open. We imagine of robots doing our assignments,exams free colleges,flying cars,meeting our favourite celebs almost everyday and on and on and on. A life which is fictinol would comprise of anything iyou want . All your stress would never exists. You would have no worries and only fun. We spend huge chunks of our life emersed in novels,films,tv shows and other mediums. This gifts birth to our imagination. The genre of fiction is like an ocean which reasonably has no possible end. God has given us the valuable gift of imagination for a reason. The reason is that we imagine things and find ways of turning that into reality or to reach a happy place in life . But having said that we should not get completly immersed into a dream life and loose the touch with reality,what we should do is live a practical lives with a sprinkle of imagination. See dreams, believe in them and work your hardest to turn your imagination into reality. If life would be fictional we would have nothing to worry about but our life is made up of 99% reality and 1% fiction, that 1% is the magic we believe in , the faith we have, the hope in our hearts. Concluding my article i would like to say that we do not have a fictional life but we sure have a mind which has the power to move mountains if we decide.

                  why colleage life is important part of life??
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  through responsibilities are part of our life but friends are imaportant too.friendship made in college is an important part of one's personal desicion. because we accept people judiciously. it's not likw in school where ever classmate and every person we talk to become our very good friends. friendship made in college last long. and are deeper. and of course we learn to be diplomatic too. that's an important part of one's growth. we feel ourselves getting elder.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  college life a very important part of every individual's life. we ll are at a certain threshold after passing out from school. that's when we have to take a very important desicion. that's regarding one's carrer. school is a small institution.college broadens one's horizon. it's a bigger place. a boarder platform to understand and prove ourseleves. it's a place where one is assumed to be an adult. need to be a little more mature than how we were at school. it's a place where we create a bigger foundation of ourlife. it's place where we find and create ourselves.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  college life is a bound free life. here nobody is behind anbody for doing class. nobody is there to see who is bunkingand where they are. that's why amidst sll fun of bunking there lies a responsibility of every stuent to understand that how much loss or gain they are doing to themselves by that. fun and sincerity should not happen at the cost of other. otherwise we will miss out one or both. some pepole get married just after college. some choose to do job and some go for higher studies. everyone havetheir own choices. so colleage life is a very memorable part of everyone's scarpbook, personal diary, photo album or anything else. so guies dont waste your college memorable life.

                In the world full of enemies and cruel people, there stands two individuals whose love is unconditional and only those are our in real sense. From the starting till the end -
                <br>
                <br>
                ”PARENTS... Yes parents are the one who put up there child above their own needs and wants. After becoming parents, a couple's life is centered around their little bunch of happiness. A couple transforms into "Mummy" and "Daddy" and everything before 'us' is then converted into 'our baby'. Throughout their life, they provide the best things for their children, whereas, sometimes they go beyond their limits just for their kids so that they won't be facing the same problems that they had faced in their past life. They are the ones who serve as role models for their children not only through their direct interaction with their child but also by sharing their lives. Parents have unconditional love for kids. Just by entering into their old age, parents turn out be similar to kids and need to be loved and taken care of. And the thing which matters the most is that, parents never retire. Maybe their words of wisdom don’t hold relevance in today’s world but experience is the best teacher. After all sacrifices if a parent doesn’t even gets love and respect, imagine what would be their condition. Just genuine love and being there when they need us is more than sufficient for them to feel proud of their upbringing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Parents are those trunk of a tree which bare beautiful branches and flourish them to reach up to the sky...With love and harmony, both, parents and children make up a beautiful and peaceful atmosphere to live in.
